## üîç KQL Description
#### This query is designed to:
#### 1.Inventory Wi-Fi-connected devices and their network configurations.
#### 2.Identify public IP addresses in use.
#### 3.Geolocate those IPs to detect anomalies (e.g., a device showing a public IP from an unexpected country).
#### 4.Provide visibility into network adapter details, including vendor and status.
