## üîç KQL Description
#### This query is used to:
#### 1.Identify potentially suspicious signed binaries in the environment.
#### 2.Detect abuse of code signing certificates by threat actors.
#### 3.Support threat hunting and malware analysis.
#### 4.Reduce false positives by excluding known good vendors.
## üß© MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
#### Tactic:Defense Evasion
#### Goal: Adversaries may use signed binaries to bypass security controls.
#### Technique: Signed Binary Proxy Execution (T1218)
#### Attackers may use signed, trusted binaries to execute malicious payloads, leveraging the trust associated with digital signatures.
